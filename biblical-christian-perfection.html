            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>“These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God” (Genesis 6:9)</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil.” (Job 1:1)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“And the Lord said into satan, hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?” (Job 1:8)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Let us (the apostle Paul, the Christians in Philippi, and true, Bible-obeying Christians, today) as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">God shall reveal even this unto you” (Philippians 3:15)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father Which in Heaven is perfect”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">(Matthew 5:48)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">God’s Word also commands you to be perfect, not “try your best.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Yes, in the Word of God, the Lord Jesus Christ commands Christians to be perfect (“telios” in Greek, meaning: complete in mentality, growth, moral character [essentially,</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Biblical perfection means that you always do everything that you know that you should do, and you never do anything that you know that you shouldn’t do]).</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Noah, Job, Paul, the Philippian Christians, and Bible-obeying true Christians throughout the ages, (including myself, my wife, and many true Bible-obeying Christian brethren of ours) have chosen to love God and Christ enough to deny themselves and live only to please Him, by living in complete obedience to His Word. God is “not a respecter of persons (impartial). He helped them in their choice to obey His Biblical command to “be perfect”; and if you choose to make the same choice He’ll give you the same Help.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">If you study this verse carefully, you will notice that the Holy Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, states that every person (besides the Lord Jesus Christ, when He was in the flesh) has sinned. "Sinned" is a past participle. Observe that the Scripture does not say "for all ARE sinning" or "for all WILL sin". Nor does the Scripture declare "for all ARE SIINNERS". Again, all that is stated is the obvious Scriptural Truth, that-besides the Lord Jesus Christ Who "was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4:15) - all people have, at least once in their lives, or more, committed sin.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid, How shall we, that ARE DEAD TO SIN, live any longer therein?" (Romans 6:1-2)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Here, the Holy Spirit inspires the Apostle Paul to ask the professed believers in Rome a rhetorical question: "Should one professing to be a Biblical Christian CONTINUE (present participle) in sin, or, continue to live a life of which sin is a part? Paul gives the obvious Scriptural answer to the question: "GOD FORBID", or, in other words, emphatically, "NO!"</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord…being then made FREE FROM SIN, ye became the servants of righteousness… but now being made FREE FROM SIN, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life” (Romans 6:11, 18,22)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">God’s Word commands true Biblical saints (not “sinners”: Biblically, you can’t be spiritually alive as “saints” are, and spiritually dead as “sinners” are, simultaneously, or at the same time) to reckon (think, estimate, suppose, conclude –and also, of course, live in accordance to the Biblically-established Truth) themselves dead to all sin forever, and alive to God through the Lord Jesus Christ.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">God’s Word also declares that true Biblical saints of the Lord Jesus Christ are “made” (by the Lord Jesus Christ, Whom they choose to Biblically love by always obeying Him and not sinning against Him) free from sin. God’s Word declares that this freedom from all sin, in Christ, is what affords true Biblical obeyers of Christ to have “everlasting”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">(Romans 6:22) and “eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord” (Romans 6:23)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">God’s Word says that, through the death, burial, resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, for mankind’s sins, in Christ, one is to live dead to sin, and alive to Christ and His righteousness. This doesn’t just mean an “expunging of sin”. It means a liberation, an emancipation, an actual, practical, experiential, freedom from sin and its power: being set totally, completely, eternally free, to love, obey and serve Christ as the Bible commands, holy, perfect, righteous, free from all sin. Praise God!</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">For example, when the Emancipation Proclamation set the slaves in the United States free, it didn’t just set them free “in word only”, while they continued to live lives as slaves. No, the slaves were set free from the bondage of slavery to become new men and women, free men and women, had become new beings, in a sense, to live a new life.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In the same way, through the shed Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, Who literally was a Substitute for all of mankind’s sin, we can be not only freed from the bondage and consequence of sin, but we are also to be freed from the power of sin to live a life of loving, willing, obedient, sin-free submission under a new Power: the Power of the Holy (“sinless”) Spirit!</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“He that committeth sin is of the devil” (1 John 3:8)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“…Whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him’ (1 John 3:7)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin” (1 John 3:9)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Whosoever abideth in Him (Christ) sinneth not” (1 John 3:6)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not” (1 John 5:18)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">God’s Word states, plainly, unmistakably, that whoever sins is of the devil, not of Christ, and has neither seen nor known Christ, Biblically. Whoever sins, God’s Word says, is not a Biblical Christian.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against Me, Him will I blot out of My Book” (Exodus 32:33)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“And whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:15)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">If you claim to be a “Christian”, but also claim to be a “sinner”, according to Scripture, you are ignorantly claiming to be a non-Christian heading for the fires of Hell.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;</span><br></p></div>
