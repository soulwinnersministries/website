            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>In examining Romans 5:12, one must, of course, not only read the entire chapter (then re-read the chapters both preceding and succeeding it), but must carefully and prayerfully study 5:12-19, as discussion of the subject of sin and righteousness continues through the chapter's end.</p><p>From Romans 5:12 until the end of the chapter, sin and righteousness are juxtaposed. Adam and Christ are also juxtaposed, compared, contrasted, paralleled, as exhibited in 5:14: "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of Him (Christ) that was to come." Perceiving this correlation or parallel made between Adam and Christ is crucial to a proper understanding of the chapter, especially verses 12-19.</p><p>Because Adam and Christ are compared, contrasted, correlated, paralleled, verse by verse, what is attributed to one must be attributed to the other. For example, if we choose to claim that Adam's sin literally, directly, and causally, made every person, constitutionally, a sinner, we must also choose to claim that Christ's Sinless-ness literally, directly, and causally, made every person, constitutionally, sin-free. To use mathematics, briefly, to illustrate, if a=b, then if I choose to add 1 to a, I must also add 1 to b, thus developing the original equation of a=b, to 1+a=1+b.</p><p>In other words, Adam’s sin, or disobedience, is paralleled by Christ’s Sinless-ness, or obedience. If I, therefore, assert that Adam’s sin was and is  causational to all being sinful, or having a “sinful nature”, I must, of a necessity, therefore, also assert that Christ’s Sinless-ness was and is causational to all being sin-free.</p><p>Keeping this principle of the necessity of treating both sides of both a mathematical equation and/or a spiritual correlation/parallel equally, let us contextually analyze verse 19 of Romans 5:</p><p>"For as by one man's (Adam's) disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One (Christ) shall many be made righteous."</p><p>As above-mentioned, if Adam's sin was causational to everyone being made a sinner, independent of their choosing to sin, then Christ's Sinless-ness must be causational to everyone being made sinless, independent of their choosing to be sinless or sin-free. Again, if Adam's sin has made everyone a sinner, independent of their free-will choice to sin, then Christ's sinless-ness has made everyone sinless, independent of their free-will choice to live sinless or sin-free. But does Scripture anywhere claim that everyone is sinless, independent of their choice to be so?</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We know from Romans 6:1-2, 7, 11, 18, 22, 1 John 3:9; 1 John 5:18, and a host of other Scriptures, that those who are Biblically born of God (born-again) exercise their free-will choice, through Biblically repenting from sin, and placing faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, to live lives of loving, complete, sin-free obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ. But does God's Word, in any place, declare that every person –even those who are not Biblically born of God- has been made, manifestly, sin-free, by Christ's sin-free Life, independent of their free-will choice to be made so?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The answer to the question above, of course, is “no, Christ’s Sin-free life does make everyone (or anyone, for that matter) sin-free, independent of their choice to be so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Because:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">a. Christ's Choice to live a Sin-free Life did not cause anyone to be sin-free, but was an occasion by which as many as choose to live sin-free can live sin-free;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">and</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">b. Adam and Christ are paralleled, compared in Romans 5:12-19; and, in a comparison, parallel, or, an equation, one must do to one side of the equation or parallel what one does to the other side of the equation or parallel;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We must now, as we examined the effect of Christ's Sinless-ness on others, examine the necessary nature of the effect of Adam's sin on others:</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned” (Romans 5:12)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin” (James 4:17)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto to them will I give it, and they shall possess it” (Deuteronomy 1:39)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Yet ye say, Why? Doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live. The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son, he shall surely live. The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear shall not bear the iniquity if the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.” (Ezekiel 18:19-20)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.” (Deuteronomy 24:16)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, wherein the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.” (2 Kings 14:6)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The above-mentioned Scriptures, analyzed in light of the previously-discussed rule of correct Biblical interpretation –in which, when two subjects are paralleled/equated/compared, one must apply the same principle of interpretation to both of the said subjects- tell us the following:</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">1. Adam was the first man. Adam chose to sin. Because Adam chose to sin, Adam died, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">because one choosing to sin causes death to come upon the one who chooses to sin. </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Because death comes only upon the individual who chooses to sin, as eternal life comes to </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">only upon the individual who chooses to no longer sin and instead life in sinless obedience to </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">the Lord Jesus Christ, death came upon all men&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">because all men chose, individually, chose to </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">follow Adam’s example and sin. Adam’s sin was not causational to all men sinning, just as </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Christ’s Sinless-ness was not causational to some men choosing to live a sinless life, through </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Christ.  Rather, Adam’s sin was an “occasional” or “influence” for men to choose to follow and </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">sin, just as Christ’s Sinless-ness was an “Occasion” or “Influence” for men to choose to follow </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">live without sin, through Him.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">2. James 4:17 informs that sin is when one “knoweth to do good, and doeth it not”, thereby, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">specifically defining sin as a choice, made when one has knowledge of good and evil but </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">chooses to do evil instead of choosing to do good. Deuteronomy 1:39 reveals that children </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“have no knowledge of good and evil”. Because sin is Biblically defined as a choice which </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">requires one to have knowledge of good and evil, because everyone begins life by being born </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">as a child, and because every child is born with no knowledge of good and evil, we must </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">logically deduce that no child is born a sinner, or one who has a “sinful nature” or “sinful </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">native constitution; no person is born in a state of moral depravity. Because no child is born a </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">sinner, or with a “sinful nature”, and because every adult begins life by being born as a child, it </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">follows that no adult is born a sinner, or with a “sinful nature”, or with “original sin”.</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">3. Romans 3:23 states that “all have sinned”, meaning that all have chosen to sin, as –as has </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">been earlier examined, sin is Biblically defined as a choice of one’s free moral agency or </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">volition, not a causation force or substance in back of the will, or lodged in the human spirit. </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Ezekiel 18:4 declares “the soul that sinneth, it (the individual soul who chooses to sin) shall </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">die. Deuteronomy 24:16 says that “every man shall be put to death for his own sin.” Ezekiel </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">18:20 says “the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">of the wicked shall be upon him.” These Scripture state, clearly, that one person’s choice to </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">sin is not imputed, attributed, or, accounted, to anyone else. For example, if a civil judge </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">charged an innocent child with the crime of its grandfather, justifying his action with the </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">claim that the child had inherited a “criminal nature” from its grandfather, the judge would be </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">charged with being unjust. And if God were to charge every individual with the sin of Adam, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">and justify this by claiming that every individual inherited a “sinful nature” from Adam, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">because of Adam’s choice to sin, God would justly be charged with injustice, and would be no </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">longer fit to act as the Moral Governor of the Universe, and govern justly. Because God is Just, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">however, the doctrine of men being born with and having a “sinful nature” is, necessarily, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">unjust.</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">4. Genesis 1:27, 31 states: “So God created man in His own Image, in the Image of God created </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">He him; male and female created He them…And God saw every thing that he had made, and </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">behold, it was very good.” Leviticus 11:45 declares “For I am the Lord that bringeth you up out </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.” God is Holy, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Innocent of sin, Sin-less. Because of this, when God created man in God’s Holy, Innocent, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Sinless Image (“similitude, resemblance, representative figure”, in Hebrew) in God’s Holy, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Innocent, Sinless Likeness, man, necessarily was innocent of sin. God saw man and evaluated </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">man as “good”. When man, Adam, chose to sin, his choice to sin marred or corrupted his moral </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">character. But that choice to sin did not change his nature or his “native constitution” </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">(“nature” is defined in Random House College Dictionary as “the particular combination of </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">qualities belonging to a person, animal, thing, class by birth, origin, or constitution”). For </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">example, it is natural for a human to walk, it is natural for a bird to fly, yet a human does not </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">change its nature into that of a bird by choosing to fly. God created man in God’s Image, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Likeness, Nature. God’s Word never states that God ever re-created man in sin’s image, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">likeness, nature. Every human individual is still born into God’s Image, Likeness, Nature. </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Unfortunately, every human individual chooses to misuse their God-given Image, Likeness, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Nature –possessing free choice/free moral agency/free volition, as God Himself possesses- </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">by choosing to sin (acting selfishly, to gratify one’s desires at the expense of the highest good </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">of all) instead of choosing to live benevolently (acting to promote the highest good of all, at </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">the expense of one’s desires). Because the majority of human individuals choose to sin </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">regularly, habitually, it becomes normal or natural for them to sin. But this is not because they </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">have inherited a “sinful nature” which causes them to sin. It is simply because that, by </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">regularly misusing their God-given faculties of volition (will), intellect (mind), sensibility </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">(emotion), they have been accustomed to, or developed a habit of, sinning. Biblically, then, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">nobody has a “sinful nature”. Biblically, people simply have created a “sinful lifestyle or habit.” </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Just as one is born morally innocent and chooses to develop a habit of sin by choosing to </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">follow Adam’s sinful example, one can be Biblically “born of God/born from above/born again’ </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">and choose to develop a habit of sinless-ness by choosing to follow Christ’s Sinless Example, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">and appropriate the means of His Grace as elucidated in Scripture (faith in His Death, Burial, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Resurrection, Heavenly Intercession, Blood, Holy Spirit, Word, etc…).</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">5. If human begins actually possessed a “sinful nature”, and, therefore, by definition, were </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">beings natively, originally, constituted and created in sin who could never do anything, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">therefore, besides sin, then God would be unjust to command human beings to “sin no more, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">lest a worse thing come unto thee” (John 5:14), “go and sin no more” (John 8:11), “awake to </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">righteousness and sin not” (1 Corinthians 15:34). Again, because God is Just, however, the </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">false doctrines of “original sin” and a “sinful nature” must, necessarily, be, Biblically, logically, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">and morally, unjust.</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">6. Texts often used to support the idea of humans having a “sinful nature”, when exegetically </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">examined syntactically and contextually, actually are found to neither support, nor </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">substantiate the erroneous doctrine. In fact, the very verses used, out of context, as </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">evidence of the universally-accepted false doctrine, actually, when properly, contextually, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">syntactically, logically, analyzed, prove the opposing view. Psalm 51:5, for centuries, has been </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">such a verse. Unfortunately, in analyzing this particular verse, theologians have forgotten a </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">basic syntactical and linguistic principle and practice, utilized throughout God’s Word. Often, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">in Scripture, the inspired writer of a particular verse will state a fact, then restate the same </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">fact, using another set of words, for emphasis. This is the case with the text under </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">consideration. David states, in the portion of Psalm 51:5 before the semi colon, “Behold, I was </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">shapen (“chuwl” or “chiyl” in Hebrew, meaning “to writhe in pain [especially of parturition </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">{“the act of bringing forth young; childbirth}) in iniquity”. Syntactically, or, concerning the </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">parts of speech included in the portion examined, “I” is the subject of the phrase. But “I”, the </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">subject, is referred to as a passive subject, or a direct object, one that is being acted upon by </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">another, as opposed to one that is acting upon another. “Shapen” is the verb in the phrase, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">pertaining to the active or passive action of the subject. Because “shapen” is modified by </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“was”, indicating that the subject, “I”, “was shapen”, it is apparent that the subject “I” was </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">passively acted upon –“was shapen” (or, was birthed) - by another active agent who did the </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“shaping” (the bringing forth of the child in birth).  “In iniquity” serves as the prepositional </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">phrase, indicating the environment in which the subject, “I” was “shapen” or “birthed. The </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">portion of the Scripture that follows after the semi colon, let it be remembered, is simply a </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">restatement of the preceding phrase. In the latter phrase, David, therefore declares that “and </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">in sin did my mother conceive me”. “In sin” corresponds with “in iniquity” in the preceding </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">phrase, indicating the environment in which David was born. “Did conceive”, correlates with </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“was shapen” in indicating the action which took place (however, it should be noted that “did </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">conceive indicates an active subject acting in the second phrase, whereas “was shapen” </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">implies, as previously discussed, a passive subject, in the first phrase, which was acted upon). </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">It refers to the active action of the subject in conceiving, or, giving birth to, David. “My </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">mother” is the explicit subject of the latter phrase and the implied subject of the former. </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Based on this, because it is clearly stated that David’s mother was, naturally, the one who </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">actively chose to shape, or give birth to, David, of a necessity, she was also the one who </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">chose to conceive (“yacham”, in Hebrew” meaning, literally, “to be hot”, “ to conceive”) David. </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Because the prepositional phrase “in sin” refers to the environment in which the active </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">subject and agent (David’s mother) conceived and birthed the passive agent or direct object </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">of the subject’s action (David), it follows that David’s mother chose the engage in the sexual </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">intercourse necessary to conceive and give birth to the infant David, while in a state of sin. </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Historically, it is believed that David’s mother was a concubine of Nahash the Ammonite. Of </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">course, intercourse between a Jew and an Ammonite would be sinful. Additionally, because, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">as we have already proven, sin is a choice requiring the knowledge of good and evil, and </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">children (let alone new born infants) do not possess knowledge of good and evil (until the </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">intellectual and moral faculties develop and mature to the point that the individual child </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">cogitatively understand these concepts), David, as a new born infant, was incapable of </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">knowing good and evil, and therefore was in a state incapable of committing sin, or being “in </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">sin”. Obviously, this verse does not at all state that David was born a sinner or possessed a </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“sinful nature”. The verse simply states that David, though morally innocent at birth, was born </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">into an environment in which sexual sin was, or had been, prevalent. This is consistent with </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">the tenor of the rest of the Psalm, as well. Throughout the Psalm, David laments his sexual </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">sin. Based on this, the 5th verse of the Psalm emphasizes that the sexual sin that he chose to </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">commit in his later years was, perhaps, influenced by the sexual sin of his mother (which may </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">or may not have continued after he was born; interestingly, though mothers are mentioned in </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">the lives of many of the Bible’s great men –Abel, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Samuel, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Solomon, John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus Christ, Timothy- David’s mother is not mentioned </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">–possibly as a result of her sin).</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Now that you have read the aforementioned documents, some of the essential, but oftentimes neglected, rejected, or not rightly divided doctrines, that it is crucial that we discuss (because incorrect understanding of these subjects has resulted in multitudes being given incomplete, eternally-devastating, and erroneous, Biblical information) are:</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">1. Rightly divided, God's Word teaches that people are not born "sinners", with a "sinful nature" </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">or with "original sin" (inherited sin from Adam). Throughout church history, the erroneous </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">doctrines of "original sin", the "inherited sinful nature", or what is theologically known as the </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">doctrine of "constitutional moral depravity", have deceived billions into believing that they </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">must "sin everyday in word, thought and deed", though God's Word says "go and sin no more" </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">(John 8:11), "sin no more lest a worse thing come unto you" (John 5:14), "he that is born of </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">God doth not commit sin" (1 John 3:9), "whosoever is born of God sinneth not" (1 John 5:18), </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">"whosoever abideth in Him (Christ) sinneth not" (1 John 3:6), "awake to righteousness and sin </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">not" (1 Corinthians 15:34), "Thy Word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee" </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">(Psalms 119:11), "that His (God's) fear be before your faces, that ye sin not" (Exodus 20:20), </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">inmany more places than I am able to cite at this time. Sadly, it is certain that multitudes are </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">in Hell, because they were incorrectly taught, by the "traditions of men", that they had to </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">continue in sin, when the Word of God said that they were to live "dead to sin, but alive </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">through Jesus Christ" (Romans 6:11).</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">2. After initially repenting from sin and surrendering to Christ, Biblical believers must </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">continue living in loving, faith-filled, sin-free, Biblical obedience to Christ, "continuing in His </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Word" (John 8:30-31) in order to maintain their Biblical Christian status.</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">3. Believers must be Biblically filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8)</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">4. Believers must be Biblically baptized in water (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 2:38)</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">5. Believers must witness or preach the Gospel to "every creature" (Mark 16:15, Matthew </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">28:18-20, Luke 24:45-49, Ezekiel 3:17-20)</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">May the Lord Jesus Christ bless you, as you Biblically obey Him.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
